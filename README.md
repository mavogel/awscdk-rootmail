# awscdk-rootmail

A single email box for all your root user emails in all AWS accounts of the organization. 
- The cdk implementation and **adaption** of the [superwerker](https://superwerker.cloud/) rootmail feature. 
- See [here](docs/adrs/rootmail.md) for a detailed Architectural Decision Record ([ADR](https://adr.github.io/))

## TL;DR ⚡
Each AWS account needs one unique email address (the so-called "AWS account root user email address").

Access to these email addresses must be adequately secured since they provide privileged access to AWS accounts, such as account deletion procedures.

This is why you only need 1 mailing list for the AWS Management (formerly *root*) account, 
we recommend the following pattern `aws-roots+<uuid>@mycompany.test` 

> [!NOTE]
> Maximum **64** characters are allowed for the whole address. 

And as you own the domain `mycompany.test` you can add a subdomain, e.g. `aws`, for which all EMails will then be received with this solution within this particular AWS Management account.

Feel free to take a look at the design

## Usage ✨

Install the dependencies:
```sh
brew install aws-cli node@18 esbuild
```

You can chose via embedding the construct in your cdk-app or use is directly via Cloudformation.
### cdk 🤖
1. To start a new project we recommend using [projen](https://projen.io/).
   1. Create a new projen project
   ```sh
   npx projen new awscdk-app-ts
   ```
   2. Add `@mavogel/awscdk-rootmail` as a dependency to your project in the `.projenrc.ts` file
   3. Run `yarn run projen` to install it
2. In you `main.ts` file add the following code
```ts
import { Rootmail } from '@mavogel/awscdk-rootmail';
import {
  App,
  Stack,
  StackProps,
  aws_route53 as r53,
} from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps = {}) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const domain = 'mycompany.com' // registered via Route53 in the SAME account

    const hostedZone = r53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'rootmail-parent-hosted-zone', {
      domainName: domain,
    });

    new Rootmail(this, 'rootmail', {
      // 1. a domain you own, registered via Route53 in the SAME account
      domain: domain,
      // 2. so the subdomain will be aws.mycompany.test and
      subdomain: 'aws',
      // 3. wired / delegated automatically to
      wireDNSToHostedZoneID: hostedZone.hostedZoneId,
    });
  }
}
```
2. run on your commandline
```sh
yarn run deploy
```
1. No need to do anything, the NS records are **automatically** propagated as the parent Hosted Zone is in the same account!
2. The `hosted-zone-dkim-propagation-provider.is-complete-handler` Lambda function checks every 10 seconds if the DNS for the subdomain is propagated. Details are in the Cloudwatch log group.

### cdk with your own receiver function 🏗️
You might also want to pass in you own function on what to do when an EMail is received

> [!TIP]
> You can add any custom code as receiver function you want.

<details>
  <summary>... click here for the details</summary>

file `functions/custom-ses-receive-function.ts` which gets the 2 environment variables populated
- `EMAIL_BUCKET`
- `EMAIL_BUCKET_ARN`

as well as `s3:GetObject` on the `RootMail/*` objects in the created Rootmail `S3` bucket. 

```ts
import { S3 } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { ParsedMail, simpleParser } from 'mailparser';
// populated by default
const emailBucket = process.env.EMAIL_BUCKET;
const emailBucketArn = process.env.EMAIL_BUCKET_ARN;
const s3 = new S3();

// SESEventRecordsToLambda
// from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-action-lambda-event.html
export const handler = async (event: SESEventRecordsToLambda) => {
    for (const record of event.Records) {
        
        const id = record.ses.mail.messageId;
        const key = `RootMail/${id}`;
        const response = await s3.getObject({ Bucket: emailBucket as string, Key: key });
        
        const msg: ParsedMail = await simpleParser(response.Body as unknown as Buffer);
        
        let title = msg.subject;
        console.log(`Title: ${title} from emailBucketArn: ${emailBucketArn}`);
        // use the content of the email body 
        const body = msg.html;
        // add your custom code here ...

        // dummy example: list s3 buckets
        const buckets = await s3.listBuckets({});
        if (!buckets.Buckets) {
            console.log('No buckets found');
            return;
        }
        console.log('Buckets:');
        for (const bucket of buckets.Buckets || []) {
            console.log(bucket.Name);
        }
    }

};
```
and you create a separate `NodejsFunction` as follows with the additionally needed IAM permissions:
```ts
const customSesReceiveFunction = new NodejsFunction(stackUnderTest, 'custom-ses-receive-function', {
  functionName: PhysicalName.GENERATE_IF_NEEDED,
  entry: path.join(__dirname, 'functions', 'custom-ses-receive-function.ts'),
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
  logRetention: 1,
  timeout: Duration.seconds(30),
});

// Note: any additional permissions you need to add to the function yourself!
customSesReceiveFunction.addToRolePolicy(new iam.PolicyStatement({
  actions: [
    's3:List*',
  ],
  resources: ['*'],
}))
```
and then pass it into the `Rootmail` Stack
```ts
export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps = {}) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const domain = 'mycompany.test'
    const hostedZone = r53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'rootmail-parent-hosted-zone', {
      domainName: domain,
    });

    const rootmail = new Rootmail(this, 'rootmail-stack', {
      domain: domain;
      autowireDNSParentHostedZoneID: hostedZone.hostedZoneId,
      env: {
        region: 'eu-west-1',
      },
      customSesReceiveFunction: customSesReceiveFunction, // <- pass it in here
    }); 
  }
}
```

## Known issues
- [jsii/2071](https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/2071): so adding  `compilerOptions."esModuleInterop": true,` in `tsconfig.json` is not possible. See aws-cdk usage with[typescript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/#Usage_with_TypeScript). So we needed to change import from `import AWS from 'aws-sdk';` -> `import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';` to be able to compile.
- Starting with this release, this construct requires `aws-cdk-lib` `>=2.263.0` and depends on `cdk-nag` `v3`, which replaced its suppression API (`NagSuppressions`) with CDK's native `Validations.of(construct).acknowledge(...)`. If you run `cdk-nag`'s `AwsSolutionsChecks` yourself against a stack containing this construct, be aware of the following gaps in what it can suppress on your behalf:
  - `AwsSolutions-IAM4[Policy::...]` findings (AWS managed policies) cannot be acknowledged at all right now: `aws-cdk-lib`'s `Validations.acknowledge()` rejects any rule ID containing more than one `::`, and every AWS managed policy ARN contains one. This is a currently open upstream bug — see [cdklabs/cdk-nag#2359](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag/issues/2359) and [#2351](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag/issues/2351).
  - `AwsSolutions-L1` (Lambda runtime), `AwsSolutions-SF1`/`SF2` (Step Functions logging/X-Ray on the internal custom-resource provider framework), and IAM findings on the shared `LogRetention` singleton are not suppressed by this construct — these were never checked before this release either.
  - Granular `AwsSolutions-IAM5[Resource::<value>]` findings that embed a CDK-generated logical ID or your account/region are not portably suppressible by a shared construct library, since the acknowledged value is specific to how you instantiate `Rootmail` in your own app. Only the portable forms (`Resource::*`, a literal `Action::<name>`) are acknowledged internally.
  - Synthesized CloudFormation templates no longer carry the v2-style `Metadata.cdk_nag.rules_to_suppress` block; acknowledgments are recorded as construct metadata instead. If you rely on that metadata for compliance tooling, run `cdk-nag` yourself with `writeSuppressionsToCloudFormation: true`.

## Related projects / questions
- [aws-account-factory-email](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-account-factory-email): a similar approach with SES, however you need to manually configure it upfront and also it about delivering root mails for a specific account to a specific mailing list and mainly decouples the real email address from the one of the AWS account. The main difference is that we do not *hide* or decouple the email address, but more make those as unique and unguessable/bruteforable as possible (with `uuids`).
- The question `Is it best practise to use a shared mailbox as AWS root user address?` from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76739635/is-it-best-practise-to-use-a-shared-mailbox-as-aws-root-user-address): yes of course you can also use `root+alias-1@mycompany.com` and `root+alias-2@mycompany.com` etc. for your
root EMail boxes.
